# Helix Sandbox NG
Helix Sandbox Next Generation

## About

The Helix Sandbox NG (Next Generation) is a back-end platform for prototyping IoT applications and smart environments certified by the FIWARE Foundation in 2018. Introducing an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, a simplified installation process that performs the rapid orchestration of the main Generic Enablers and empowers integration and interoperability with the largest number of IoT devices and technologies.

Designed to fasten the development of PoCs (Proof of Concept), MVPs (Minimum Viable Product), accelerate IoT learning by undergraduate and graduate students, enhance scientific research and experimental applications in the areas of Smart Cities, Industry 4.0, agrifood, logistics, ports, retail, home, health and content with minimal cost and computational resources. The Sandbox is free to use for educational propose and grants 90 days of free use for commercial applications. 

The lightweight approach based on microservices is capable of run with low investment in any CSP (Cloud Service Providers), hypervisor or on your own machine. The architecture integrates the new generation of the powerful CEF Context Broker, which enables a new generation of applications for intelligent environments, exploring context information on a large scale and in real-time, with an emphasis on interoperability based on the NGSI-LD API defined by ETSI (European Network of Telecommunications Standards) and that integrates the CEF (Connecting Europe Facility).

The platform natively supports HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) protocols through the embedded integration of Eclipse-Mosquitto, suitable for use with low power devices.

The Helix platform provides Cloud Service in a pay-as-you-go payment and a Bespoke platform deployed over Nebula which integrates advanced security features, databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB or AWS DynamoDB, as well as BigData platforms like Hadoop, Storm, Spark and Flink, in addition to interoperating with IoT protocols such as CoAP, LWM2M, OPC-UA, LoRaWAN and SigFox.

Helix Sandbox NG is currently in use as Fiware Lab São Paulo's main image.

Give your smart environment application the ability to analyse, share, manage and use in real time at right time!

We crossed Jupiter's orbit!
